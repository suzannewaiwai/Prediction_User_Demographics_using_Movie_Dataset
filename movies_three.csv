Fourteen-year-old Ponyboy Curtis is the youngest of three orphaned brothers who live on the north side of town, the ""wrong side"" of the tracks. Sensitive Ponyboy used to have a good relationship with his oldest brother Darrel, but since Darrel became the household caregiver, he is always on Ponyboy's case. Caught in the middle is third brother Sodapop, who dropped out of school to work full time. They all belong to The Greasers, a gang of boys from the north side also from working class families, often broken. Ponyboy's main concern is that any problem they may encounter, especially in their Greaser activities, will lead to the authorities splitting up their family. He also believes Darrel would have outgrown them and become something in his life if it wasn't for his loyalty to the gang, and the need to take care of the family. The rest of the world sees the Greasers as all the same, the face being Dallas Winston, the most volatile one who has just been released from prison, despite each boy having his own specific view of life. Similarly, the world sees the Socs, the Greasers' primary rivals, as all the same, rich spoiled entitled boys with a sense of superiority from the south side of town, despite again each boy being his own person. A connection between the two gangs happens in the form of Ponyboy and Cherry Valance, which doesn't sit well with Cherry's Soc boyfriend, Bob Sheldon. As a result, an incident occurs involving the Socs, Ponyboy and fellow Greaser, sixteen-year-old Johnny Cade, an equally sensitive boy who wants a better life for himself, but seems stuck in a downward spiral with parents who don't give him the time of day. Beyond Ponyboy and Johnny's lives being threatened by that incident, the Greasers and the Socs agree to a rumble to settle things once and for all. Some of the boys realize the rumble will accomplish nothing, with the questions being if they can convince their colleagues of the same, and if not what the consequences will be.",English,"United States, France",1 win & 4 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E4Njk4N2UtZWFhOS00NzczLWFmNDgtMzdhMjFlNTZjMmVhL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,45,7.0,"100,333",tt0086066,movie,N/A,"$25,837,195",N/A,N/A

Gay can only stand by and hope for a specific verdict in the case so that Tony can return to her wholeheartedly without the specter of Mrs. Paradine hanging over their marriage.",English,United States,Nominated for 1 Oscar. 1 nomination total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzhmNTg5OTUtYmE5My00ZjNiLTkzNzctYmI4YzdjZmFkNjFiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,6.5,"12,601",tt0039694,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The donors mostly are rich black supporters of Congressman Aubrey Hale Clayton who intends to run for state governorship. After the armed robbery, the criminals disappear in a white getaway van.

At the school, he quickly notices the young cleaning woman, who he learns is twenty-five year old Sarah Norman and who, deaf herself, was once a student there and has been there since the age of five. He can see that she is bright, headstrong and angry, on top of which she doesn't speak, the latter issues a result of a troubled home life, her mother, her only touchstone to family, who she has purposefully not seen in eight years. As he is able to get through to most of his students to feel more and more comfortable in speaking for a more holistic life, Jim, with the reluctant blessing of the school's superintendent Dr. Curtis Franklin, who has always and still considers Sarah a proverbial pain in the you-know-where, tries to get Sarah to learn how to speak so that she can reach her full potential beyond being a cleaning woman, which he will further learn is a choice if only as it allows her to live her life somewhat in solitude in her silence and anger. Although unable to break through to her on the speaking side of the equation, he is able to break through on a more humanistic level as they end up falling for each other eventually embark on a relationship. The question then becomes if there is the possibility of a long term future for them, especially in being able to bridge their many divides - not only the divide between the world of the hearing and the deaf - and in Sarah never having had a sense of who she truly is as a complete human being and not just the deaf girl who may now see what Jim is doing as solely his latest ""project"".","English, American Sign ",United States,Won 1 Oscar. 6 wins & 13 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY3YjQyMjAtOGI2ZC00NDljLWJlN2QtYjNiYTMxZjIxMzQ0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,80,7.2,"18,948",tt0090830,movie,N/A,"$31,853,080",N/A,N/A

Long having retired, James Whale, arguably most famous for directing Frankenstein (1931) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935) among some other 1930s horror classics, has burned his bridges with the Hollywood community in that they have abandoned him, the possible exception being his continuing friendship with former lover David Lewis. James had been openly gay even during his working period and is in declining health. Having been recently released from a hospital where he was recuperating from a stroke, he left with some permanent health issues, the aftermath of the stroke. Much against the disapproval of his loyal longtime housekeeper Hanna, his health does not prevent him from toying with the handsome young men who may wander into his midst in his continuing homosexual desires, although Hanna is as much, if not more concerned about any of those young men taking advantage of him in his elderly and fragile state. The young man who catches his eye among the most recent is Clayton Boone, who Hanna had hired to do garden work around the property. Clay, an ex-marine from the proverbial ""wrong side of the tracks"", has no idea who James was or is before he starts this job. James and Clay soon begin a friendship of sorts. Clay is also unaware of James' homosexual orientation before such is confirmed by Hanna, an issue which threatens his masculinity, especially in light of the cracks showing in his casual sexual relationship with a slightly older and wiser diner waitress named Betty. Clay has to reconcile that threat against being in the company of someone whom he considers an interesting and once famous man. The friendship and his state of health related to the stroke lead James to reflect in a bittersweet vein on key points of his life, most notably serving in WWI, and as a result reveals his ulterior motives through the actions he takes toward Clay.","English, Hungarian","United States, United Kingdom",Won 1 Oscar. 38 wins & 33 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZiZTg1NzMtODNmMS00YzAwLWE1OTMtODdhZDZiZWJmMzk4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,74,7.3,"33,073",tt0120684,movie,N/A,"$6,451,628",N/A,N/A

Many see Monsignor Burke as autocratic, he having a very narrow and traditionally conservative view of the church in addition. Father Farley often socializes with Monsignor Burke, the two most recently having gone on vacation together to Yugoslavia, but Father Farley sees this socializing more as a professional obligation than a true want, Father Farley who will tell what he considers little white lies to get out of many of those social commitments. Father Farley will tell those little white lies in more circumstances to achieve his desired end, those lies of which his devoted, loyal and devout housekeeper Margaret refuses to be a part. Although not having much to do with the diocese's seminary, Father Farley plea bargains with the Monsignor to ordain seminarian Mark Dolson as a deacon, the Monsignor's condition being only if he is to be the deacon at St. Francis for a one month probation period. The Monsignor's original want not to ordain Mark is because Mark often openly challenges what church elders tell him, the Monsignor feeling that Mark not having the temperament not only to be a deacon but more importantly a priest. Although Father Farley had seen Mark's challenges first hand and thus sees him as much as a pain in the neck as most of those at the seminary do, he came to Mark's defense in this matter if only in not agreeing with the Monsignor's open and closed judgment of Mark, the judgment solely because Mark often disagreed with his views. In spending time with Mark, Father Farley finds that Mark doesn't have a filter between his thoughts/emotions and what comes out of his mouth, in turn the congregation as a collective not having the best initial opinion of him. A series of events leads to a specific incident placing Mark's position in the church at risk. As such, Father Farley has to make a decision about how far he is willing to go to defend Mark at the risk of his own personal and professional standing.

When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent therapist, Granville Sawyer, erupts, he finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberately fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' friend, Fred Gailey, reassures him of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact Santa Claus.

The life for the Scorpioni changes with the on-set of World War II, more specifically when Italy declares war on Britain and France. Despite all of the Scorpioni taken into custody of sorts by the Italians, they are eventually housed in the comforts of a hotel. Lady Hester wrongly believes it is her association with Mussolini (Claudio Spadaro) that has gotten them into their comfortable surroundings, but which in reality was arranged and paid for by Elsa. Luca, who has just returned to Italy after attending school in Austria, helps Elsa with her efforts to assist those persecuted in Italy. Luca, now a teenager, has fallen in love with Elsa. As such, Luca is jealous of Elsa's professional and personal relationship with Italian lawyer Vittorio Fanfanni (Paolo Seganti). Elsa's own situation becomes more precarious with the United States' entrance into the war, the Nazis' increasing persecution of Jews, and Luca discovering that Fanfanni has ulterior motives in his relationship with Elsa. Through it all, Mary still tries to be the voice of what is right to Luca, who may be tainted by his own immature teenaged thoughts during these difficult times.","English, Italian","Italy, United Kingdom",Won 1 BAFTA Award5 wins & 3 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmEzMTQxOWUtYTY4NS00YjVkLTlmMzYtNmM2MzQxMzg2ZTlhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,53,6.9,"14,397",tt0120857,movie,N/A,"$14,401,563",N/A,N/A

Overwhelmed by Nuke's generosity, Eddie accepts the gift without hesitation, unaware of it's dark role in things to come. After constant humiliation and a near drowning at the hands of school bully Tim Hainy and his sports jock friends, Eddie becomes enraged and vows revenge on all those who have wronged him, much to the dismay of love interest, Leslie and best friend, Roger. Alone in his room with feelings of rage and retribution racing through his mind, Eddie places the new record onto his stereo and is shocked to discover that he can communicate with the deceased rock star when it is rotated backwards. Playing upon both Eddie's loyalty and emotional vulnerability, Sammi instructs the teenager on how to get back at those who have caused him so much pain, instructions that the easily manipulated Eddie carries out, prompting the usual 'underdog gets his own back' results. At first it's all fun and games as Hainy and his cohorts get their just desserts, but when Hainy's girlfriend is nearly killed by supernatural forces, Eddie realizes that he is nothing more than a pawn in a much more sinister plot and wants out. When Eddie tries to destroy the record, an evil version of Sammi is resurrected (complete with supernatural powers) and goes on a rampage at the high school Halloween dance, turning Eddie's involvement with the devilish rock star into a spine tingling nightmare not only for the young headbanger, but for his school and hometown as well. Can Eddie stop the demonic Sammi before he sends the entire town straight to hell? One thing's for sure, the teenagers of Lakeridge High are in for a Halloween they'll never forget.",English,United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDMzMDBmNWEtNjdhOC00ZGIxLWJmZjUtMmRlMzNiOGJkZjdkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,57,5.8,"8,155",tt0092112,movie,N/A,"$6,797,218",N/A,N/A

Thomas Highway (Clint Eastwood) is a well-decorated career military man in the United States Marine Corps, he who has seen action in Korea and Vietnam. His current rank is Gunnery Sergeant. His experiences have led him to become an opinionated, no nonsense man, who is prone to bursts of violence, especially when he's drunk, if the situation does not suit him, regardless of the specifics or people involved. Because of these actions, he has spent his fair share of overnighters behind bars. Close to retirement, one of his last assignments, one he requested, is back at his old unit at Cherry Point, North Carolina, from where he was transferred for insubordination and conduct unbecoming. He is to train a reconnaissance platoon. His superior officer, the much younger and combat inexperienced Major Malcolm Powers (Everett McGill), sees Highway as a relic of an old-styled military. Highway's commanding officer, Lieutenant Ring (Boyd Gaines), the platoon leader, is also a younger man who has no combat experience, but is academically inclined and happy-go-lucky. Highway finds that his team is a rag-tag bunch of slackers, who includes wannabe rock musician Corporal Stitch Jones (Mario Van Peebles), with whom Highway had an inauspicious earlier meeting. The men in the platoon, who truly believe Highway is crazy, hate him, and don't understand why they have to follow his harsh training regimen when the United States is not currently at war. The Major, who is all about efficiency regardless of combat readiness, has the same views of Highway. He is clear that he sees Highway's platoon solely as a training mechanism for his own elite squad trained by Highway's nemesis, Staff Sergeant Webster (Moses Gunn).

Through it all, Highway tries to reconnect with his bar waitress ex-wife Aggie (Marsha Mason), he even clandestinely reading women's magazines to understand her better.

After a slow start and despite some people associated with Ed hamming it up to the cameras in wanting their fifteen minutes of fame or more, Ed becomes enough of a toast to the TV watching public for the network to become a success.

On the heels of her latest play, Camille is shocked to discover that her Aunt Jewel Mae ""Cookie"" Orcutt has committed suicide. Terrified at the thought of how this will tarnish the family name, she eats the suicide note to make it look like a burglary. This set-up leads the police to one main suspect, Willis Richland, who also happens to be Cookie's best friend. Although the rest of the town is convinced Willis didn't commit the crime, an outside investigator isn't so sure. As Easter Sunday and opening night of the play arrive, the truth comes out, revealing more secrets than anyone could have possibly imagined.",English,United States,3 wins & 11 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ4YWFlNmYtZTQxOS00YTUwLThiZjItYmMxZDdjODcyYWRlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,70,6.8,"13,945",tt0126250,movie,N/A,"$10,920,544",N/A,N/A

The company has yet to produce a film, Bobby's personal net worth is virtually zero, and the company only has $2,184 to its name, $1 invested into it personally by Bobby every week since he first decided he wanted to make a movie when he was a child. Bobby believes his fortunes will change when his accountant Afrim changes hats and writes a science-fiction alien invasion screenplay that Bobby thinks all studios will clamor for and has Oscar written all over it. He has a small stable of followers who support his vision in being part of this movie, which eventually includes Daisy as the lead actress, she a stereotypical small town girl looking to make it big in Hollywood. Having just arrived in town, she does not know her way around the Hollywood system,... except on her proverbial back. Bobby is not averse to telling bald-faced lies in his singular focus in getting the picture made and distributed all on this $2,184 as a starting point. It is using several of those lies that he is able to get a verbal confirmation from big studio executive Jerry Renfro to distribute the movie *if* it stars Kit Ramsey, arguably the biggest action star in the world. Using similar lies, Bobby, however, is unable to convince Kit to star in the movie. Kit, who has a weakness for the Laker Girls, is a self-absorbed and paranoid movie star whose life and thus career is largely directed behind the scenes by Terry Stricter, the head of a new age religion called MindHead. Bobby comes up with a scheme that he believes will get around Kit not agreeing to star: film Kit without him knowing that he is being filmed. The only person who knows of the scheme is Dave, Bobby's lowest of low level inside man turned cinematographer who has unofficial (i.e. technically stolen and thus free) access to studio camera equipment and general knowledge of Kit's general day-to-day movements through the studio system. Bobby is able to convince all the other actors that Kit's acting process involves him not interacting with them outside of filming the specific scenes he has with them. Part of Bobby's scheme involves using Kit's general paranoia that aliens truly are invading the planet to get his gut reactions to what is happening within the context of the script. But Bobby knows he has to get Kit to scream the closing lines of the movie ""gotcha suckas"" for the movie to be a success. Complications ensue when another of the the actors, Carol, tries to go against Bobby's policy of not making contact with Kit outside of filming, and when Bobby is required to hire a production assistant cum stunt double cum acting double, whose job in part is to stand-in for the requisite Kit Ramsey naked ass shot.

He is a husband to real estate agent Carolyn Burnham and father to high school student Jane Burnham. Although Lester and Carolyn once loved each other, they now merely tolerate each other. Typical wallflower Jane also hates both her parents; the three suffer individually in silence in their home life. Jane tries to steer clear of both her parents. Carolyn, relatively new to the real estate business, wants to create the persona of success to further her career, aspiring to the professional life of Buddy Kane, the king of the real estate business in their neighborhood. Lester merely walks mindlessly through life, including at his job in advertising. His company is downsizing, and he, like all the other employees, has to justify his position to the newly hired efficiency expert to keep his job. Things change for Lester when he falls in love at first sight with Jane's more experienced classmate, Angela Hayes. Both Janie and Angela can see Lester's sexual infatuation with Angela, who courts such attention from any man as a sign that she is model material, she having once appeared in Seventeen and is a career to which she aspires. Lester's infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life, where he openly doesn't care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does, anyone except Angela. This infatuation coincides with the Fittses moving in next door: homophobic disciplinarian US Marine Colonel Frank Fitts who rules the house with a military fist (that fist being both figurative and literal), his semi-comatose wife Barbara Fitts, and their bright and quietly subversive 18-year-old son Ricky Fitts, who openly abides by his father's rules while behind the scenes lives by his own quite different perspective. Much like Lester's infatuation, Ricky immediately becomes infatuated with Jane; he considers girls like Angela as ordinary. The entry of Angela and the Fittses into the Burnhams' lives ultimately leads to each of the players confronting what is truly in his or her heart.",English,United States,Won 5 Oscars. 112 wins & 102 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI1MDE0OTMtMmI2MS00Yjc2LTg2MTItMWExYTg5NzA1OGUzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,84,8.3,"1,226,527",tt0169547,movie,N/A,"$130,096,601",N/A,N/A

2909,"Five Wives, Three Secretaries and Me",1998,N/A,08 Oct 1999,82 min,"Comedy, Documentary, Family",Tessa Blake,Tessa Blake,"Thomas Walter Blake Jr., Muffet Criner Adickes Blake, Sandra Tessman Blake","Tessa Blake's ""Five Wives, Three Secretaries and Me"" is an odd piece of work which slowly and patiently mesmerizes the viewer, reeling us to a surprisingly poignant ending.  Early on in ""Five Wives..."" I was sure I had the film all figured out -- an often hilarious if somewhat simplistic portrait of the film-maker's father and his wacky, worldly friends.  The old coot is an interesting mix of traits: charming, cranky, controlling, creative and -- as one might expect from an 87-year-old southerner -- a racist.  But then the film takes a sudden turn for the serious when film-maker/daughter Tessa reveals she lives with a black man.  And again, I thought, ""oh, I see where this going...a subtle hatchet job on the evils of racism.""  And again I was surprised to discover that the boyfriend is really only a metaphor for what stands between father and daughter -- not only politics, but age, geography, perspective.  One wonders how these two people can ever find a solution.  One wonders how this old guy, as the protagonist of a narrative (and make no mistake, this IS a narrative film), can ever evolve enough to effect a change in his world.  And herein lies the third surprise of ""Five Wives...""  Tom Blake, charming old coot that he is, isn't our hero at all -- film-maker Tessa herself is the one we watch change and grow over the course of a few short, rich scenes, and it is Tessa who is able to make the tiniest of changes in her father's world, if only by learning to be herself.  The film concludes with a scene that is either devastating or full of hope depending on your perspective...I like to think I know which Tessa had in mind.  No matter how you crack it, it's a bittersweet tale at best. This film is perhaps the best personal documentary/memoir I have ever seen -- certainly the best of that new generation of films which includes the very moving ""Dear Jesse"" and the interesting, if less successful, ""Family Secrets.""    And lest these comments mislead, let me be clear that the film is also a riot, with actual belly-laughs amid the drama.  But the real meat here isn't the comedy, it's the intelligent examination of a culture and a family.  This is grown-up film-making for a grown-up audience, and it doesn't beg to be liked.  Blake is a patient film-maker, and the film evolves with a languid southern speed.  It can be agony waiting for molasses to fall from the jar, but the meal is worth the wait.",English,United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MzM4NzMwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE4MTAyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,52,7.2,57,tt0150574,movie,N/A,"$4,450",N/A,N/A
